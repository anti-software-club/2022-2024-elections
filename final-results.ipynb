We have a set of 13 \"competitive\" states that are considered competitive based off [2022 US Senate Election Ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_elections#Predictions). These will form our test set,and the training set will be over other states where (1) they have no Senate competition in 2022 so we use their most recent party outcome for the most recent Senate election in 2020 or (2) forecasting and demographic/polling factors strongly indicate a party direction for the Senate results, to the point where no forecasting is necessary and polling is usually sparse. The paper addresses this in more depth as a potential challenge."],"metadata":{"id":"w8tRTcWkBrH_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["null_results =
